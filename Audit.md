Audit Report
This report outlines the findings from a security audit conducted on the StorageVictim contract uisng slither, The audit focused on identifying security vulnerabilities, code optimization issues, and adherence to Solidity's best practices.

Findings & Recommendations
Pragma Version

Issue: The contract uses pragma solidity ^0.8.0;, which includes versions that are not recommended for deployment due to potential undiscovered bugs.
Recommendation: Specify a more precise pragma statement, such as pragma solidity 0.8.x; where x is the latest stable subversion, to avoid the usage of early 0.8 versions. This reduces exposure to undiscovered issues in older compiler versions.
Parameter Naming Convention

Issue: The parameter _amount in the function store does not follow the mixedCase naming convention.
Recommendation: Rename _amount to amount or another mixedCase name to adhere to Solidity's naming conventions. This enhances code readability and consistency.
Immutable State Variable

Issue: The state variable owner is set only once in the constructor and is never modified. However, it is not declared as immutable.
Recommendation: Declare owner as an immutable variable (address immutable owner;). This will save gas costs for deployments and transactions since immutable variables are treated as constants and are cheaper to access.
